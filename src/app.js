        I'm a frontend engineer. I've used mainly React in my work but by no
        means would I call myself an expert. Currently, I work at{' '}
        <a href="https://www.doctor.com" target="_blank">
          Doctor.com
        </a>
        . I've been fortunate enough to have been a part of completing many
        products and services DDC has to offer.

        Outside of coding, I like going to the great outdoors with my trusty
        four-legged companion, Pim. In contrast to my head down work, I enjoy
        the relief and exhilaration from stepping into nature and getting soaked
        by waterfalls. Being outside in nature reminds me that life goes beyond
        words and screens. Tiring out the pup is a big plus, too.
